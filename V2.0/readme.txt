This version has two more monitor and clear buttons than the previous version, and some more code to display charts.

Now the app can create charts based on each monitoring data, and can be cleared at any time, but this operation is static.

However, there may be problems when referencing the charting library, and I can't find the problem with my technical skills yet, so I'm sorry

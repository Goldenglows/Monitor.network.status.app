On top of my existing code, I added two buttons, with functionalities to monitor and clear. When the 'Monitor' button is pressed, 

it refreshes the content on the current page, outputting new monitoring data in the format 

'The signal strength for the ( )th time is: '

 below the existing data. 

It can monitor up to five times maximum. 

After pressing the monitor button five times, a toast pops up with the message

 'Please clear the monitored data'. Pressing the 'Clear' button clears all content on the page
